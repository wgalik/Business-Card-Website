  <h1 class="ps-md-2">About me</h1>
  <p class="ps-md-2">
    Hi! My name is Wojtek and I am a freelancer specializing in creating websites.
  </p>

  <p class="ps-md-2">
    I have always been fascinated by technology and its impact on our daily lives, which is why I
    decided to pursue a career in building modern and functional websites. I treat every project as
    a challenge and an opportunity to learn - and quickly picking up new skills is one of my
    strongest traits.
  </p>
  <p class="ps-md-2">
    I am not afraid of new technologies, and difficulties motivate me to take action. I consistently
    strive to achieve my goals while paying attention to aesthetics, usability, and detail. I
    believe in continuous development, so I am constantly expanding my knowledge in front-end
    development, WordPress, and PHP. This allows me to better respond to my clients' needs and
    create projects that not only look good but also perform well - fast, smoothly, and reliably.
  </p>
  <p class="ps-md-2">
    In my work, I value communication, reliability, and meeting deadlines. I enjoy challenges and
    gladly take on new projects that let me use both creativity and logical thinking.
  </p>
  <p class="ps-md-2">
    If you are looking for someone who can not only build a website but also help turn your idea
    into a real, well-functioning product - I would love to work with you!
